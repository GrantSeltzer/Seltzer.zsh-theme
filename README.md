# Seltzer.zsh-theme

My customized zsh theme

Oh-my-zsh can be aquired at http://ohmyz.sh ... If you're not using it, I highly recommend it.

If you want to use this theme , download the file and place it in /home/$USER/.oh-my-zsh/themes then go to your .zshrc file in your home directory and set ZSH_THEME to seltzer like so:

ZSH_THEME="seltzer"

Enjoy!
